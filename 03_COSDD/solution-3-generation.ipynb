    "As mentioned in the training.ipynb notebook, COSDD is a deep generative model that captures the structures and characteristics of our data. In this notebook, we'll see how accurately it can represent our training data, in both the signal and the noise. We'll do this by using the model to generate entirely new images. These will be images that look like the ones in our training data but don't actually exist. This is the same as how models like DALL-E can generate entirely new images."
