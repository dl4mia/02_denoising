    "# Noise2Void\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first exercise, we denoised images with CARE using supervised training. As \n",
    "discussed during the lecture, ground-truth data is not always available in life \n",
    "sciences. But no panic, Noise2Void is here to help!\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed Noise2Void is a self-supervised algorithm, meaning that it trains on the data\n",
    "itself and does not require clean images. The idea is to predict the value of a masked\n",
    "pixels based on the information from the surrounding pixels. Two underlying hypothesis\n",
    "allow N2V to work: the structures are continuous and the noise is pixel-independent, \n",
    "that is to say the amount of noise in one pixel is independent from the amount of noise\n",
    "in the surrounding pixels. Fortunately for us, it is very often the case in microscopy images!\n",
    "\n",
    "If N2V does not require pairs of noisy and clean images, then how does it train?\n",
    "\n",
    "First it selects random pixels in each patch, then it masks them. The masking is \n",
    "not done by setting their value to 0 (which could disturb the network since it is an\n",
    "unexpected value) but by replacing the value with that of one of the neighboring pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the network is trained to predict the value of the masked pixels. Since the masked\n",
    "value is different from the original value, the network needs to use the information\n",
    "contained in all the pixels surrounding the masked pixel. If the noise is pixel-independent,\n",
    "then the network cannot predict the amount of noise in the original pixel and it ends\n",
    "up predicting a value close to the \"clean\", or denoised, value.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use an existing library called [Careamics](https://careamics.github.io)\n",
    "that includes N2V and other algorithms:\n",
