    "CARE network you trained in the first regression exercises require that you acquire pairs\n",
    "of high and low SNR. However, this often not possible. One such case is when it is simply\n",
    "not possible to acquire high SNR images.\n",
    "\n",
    "What to do when you are stuck with just noisy images? We also have seen Noise2Void, which\n",
    "is a self-supervised method that can be trained on noisy images. But there are other \n",
    "supervised approaches that can be trained on noisy images only, such as Noise2Noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Noise2Noise relies on the same assumption than Noise2Void: the noise is pixel-independent.\n",
    "Therefore, if you supervise your network to guess a noisy image from another one, the network\n",
    "will converge to a denoised image. Of course, this only works if the two noisy images are\n",
    "very similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "To acquire data for Noise2Noise, one can simply image the same region of interest twice!\n",
    "Indeed, pixel-independent noise (as opposed to structured noise) will be completely independent\n",
    "between neighboring pixels and as well as between the two noisy images.\n",
